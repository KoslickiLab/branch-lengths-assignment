## 1. Experiment 1: recovering branch lengths using compatible distance matrices
This experiment evaluates the respective performance of the bottom-up method and the NNLS method in restoring branch lengths in the event when the distance matrix is completely compatible with the simulated tree. 
```bash
mkdir -p data/test_data/test1
cd scripts
bash test1_solve_branch_lengths.sh
cd ..
```
